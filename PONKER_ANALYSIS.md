## Advanced Technical Features

### State Management
The app uses React's `useState` hook extensively with 20+ state variables:
- Chip data management
- UI state (modals, menus, animations)
- User preferences (name, font, settings)
- Interaction states (touch, mouse position)

### Animation System
- **CSS Keyframes**: Complex animations for title letters, chips, and UI elements
- **Dynamic CSS Variables**: Runtime animation adjustments
- **Staggered Animations**: Coordinated timing for visual appeal
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses `will-change` and hardware acceleration

### Touch & Gesture Handling
- **Swipe Detection**: Minimum distance threshold (50px)
- **Long Press Detection**: 500ms timeout for color picker activation
- **Touch Prevention**: Strategic `preventDefault()` calls
- **Multi-touch Awareness**: Proper touch event management

### Color System
- **Contrast Calculation**: Automatic text color adjustment based on chip color
- **Preset Colors**: 10 standard poker chip colors
- **Custom Color Picker**: HTML5 color input integration
- **Color Validation**: Hex color parsing and processing

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Viewport Meta**: Proper mobile viewport configuration
- **Touch Targets**: Appropriately sized interactive elements
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 768px and 480px breakpoints
- **Mobile-Specific Interactions**: Touch-optimized interactions

## Design Philosophy

### Visual Design
- **Dark Theme**: Black background with white/colored text
- **Poker Aesthetic**: Authentic poker chip design with edge details
- **Modern UI**: Clean, contemporary interface design
- **Professional Polish**: High-quality visual effects and animations

### User Experience

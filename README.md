# PONKER ðŸŽ²

## About
PONKER is a web app intended to solve, or mitigate, the issue of "How much money do I have?" while playing poker. This tool is meant mainly for beginner Poker players who haven't quite gained a knack for keeping mental track of how much money their chips are worth, or how much they've lost/gained.

## Main Features
PONKER currently has a single main feature, and that's the chip counting interface. You can create "chips" assign them a value, color, and then increment a counter on each chip that will then multiply with the value of the chip to find a total value for the stack, and then the stack values are combined into a total value at the bottom of the screen.

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. **Open PONKER** in your web browser
2. **Choose a preset** (optional) - Click the Menu (â˜°) â†’ "Chip Presets" to load standard chip configurations:
   - **Standard Casino**: Traditional poker chip values ($1, $5, $10, $25, $100+)
   - **GMoney PennyPoker**: Low stakes setup (5Â¢, 10Â¢, 25Â¢)
   - **BMH "PettyPoker"**: Ultra-low stakes (1Â¢, 5Â¢, 10Â¢, 25Â¢)

### Managing Your Chips

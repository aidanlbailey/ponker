## About
PONKER is a web app designed to solve, or mitigate, the issue of "How much money do I have?" while playing poker. This tool is intended primarily for beginner poker players who haven't quite developed a knack for mentally tracking how much money their chips are worth, or how much they've lost or gained.

## Project Background & Tech Stack
This is a personal project I developed to further familiarize myself with AI coding agents (like Cursor and Copilot) while gaining hands-on experience with JavaScript and CSS. The project utilizes modern web technologies to create a responsive and intuitive poker chip tracking application.

### Tech Stack
- **React 19.1.0** - UI framework for component-based architecture
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **Pure CSS** - Custom styling with advanced animations and responsive design
- **Local Storage API** - Client-side data persistence
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features and syntax
- **Touch API** - Mobile gesture support (swipe, long-press)
- **Vibration API** - Haptic feedback for mobile devices

## Main Features
PONKER currently has a single main feature: the chip counting interface. You can create chip types assign them a value and color, and then increment a counter on each chip that multiplies with the chip's value to find a total value for the stack. The stack values are then combined into a total value displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Add and remove chips** with satisfying animated feedback
- **Customize chip colors** by clicking on them (desktop) or long pressing (mobile)
- **Set custom values** for each chip type
- **Add or remove chip types** as needed
- **Copy and paste chip data** for sharing with others
- **Toggle between showing/hiding total values**
- **Preset configurations** for common poker setups

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Three Theme Modes**:
  - **Dark Mode**: Classic dark theme with blue accents and glowing title
  - **Light Mode**: Clean light theme with dark accents and inverted title colors
  - **Felt Mode**: Authentic poker table green with felt texture and monochrome title
- **Smart Number Formatting**: Automatic comma separators for large numbers (e.g., 1,000 vs 1,000.50)
- **Flexible Total Display**: Choose to show total value at top (next to menu) or bottom
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile feedback on supported mobile devices
- **Touch Gestures**: Swipe up/down on chips to add/remove (mobile)
- **Mouse Avoidance**: Interactive title letters that move away from cursor
- **Theme Persistence**: Your theme choice is remembered between sessions

### Customization Options
- **Font Selection**: Choose from 20+ different fonts
- **User Names**: Set your name for personalized data sharing
- **Chip Presets**: Pre-configured setups for different poker games
- **Color Customization**: Full color picker for each chip type

### Data Management
